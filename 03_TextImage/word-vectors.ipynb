    "- Wikipedia articles about a common topic. We'll expect some words (e.g. singapore) to appear more frequently about that topic. Whether this is something we need to worry about is unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Architecture:\n",
    "Architecture options are skip-gram (the default: slower, better for infrequent words) or continuous bag of words (fast). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training algorithm:\n",
    "This controls which algorithm to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical softmax (the default: better for infrequent words) or negative sampling (better for frequent words, better with low dimensional vectors). Start with the default first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downsampling of frequent words:\n",
    "This controls the threshold for frequent words to be removed randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly removing frequent words in large datasets can improve both accuracy and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{f-t}{f} - \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{f}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $p$: probabability that word is present\n",
    "- $f$: frequency of word in corpus\n",
    "- $t$: the threshold (our downsampling hyperparameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "A smaller $t$ means more words will be randomly removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Source: https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/improving-distributional-similarity-tacl-2015.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Google documentation](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) recommends values between 1e-3 and 1e-5. Let's try 1e-3 and then iterate from there, since our training set is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word vector dimensionality:\n",
    "This controls how many features the word vector should have. Higher dimensionality (more features) usually result in better models, but also longer runtimes. Reasonable values can be in the tens to hundreds. We'll try 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context / window size:\n",
    "This defines the window-size to look for related words. For skip-gram usually around 10, for CBOW around 5. More is better, up to a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Worker threads:\n",
    "Number of parallel processes to run. This can significantly improve training speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The number to choose depends on how many logical CPU cores your computer has (on Windows, Start Menu -> System Information, look for Processors). \n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a number around 2-4, and then increase up if your computer is more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum word count:\n",
    "This helps limit the size of the vocabulary to meaningful words. Any word that does not occur at least this many times across all documents is ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasonable values could be between 10 and 100. Higher values also help limit run time.\n",
