The hill was known to be Mount Sophia, which was called “Bukit Selegi” during Raffles’ time.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 10 KB, 1 p..","eng","na","admin","2010-05-17","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_586_2004-12-30.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/837bb080-e5d3-4a00-b48f-f22593fcef0d?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/837bb080-e5d3-4a00-b48f-f22593fcef0d?s=SM"

Reclamation work began in the 1960s. Swampland was reclaimed using earth obtained from the levelling of hills in the area. Subsequently, land was also reclaimed in Tuas and the southern islands. In the 1990s, work commenced to combine the southern islands to form Jurong Island, with the objective of creating a petrochemicals hub. The task of developing Jurong was initially undertaken by the Economic and Development Board, but the Jurong Town Corporation (JTC) was founded in 1968 to oversee the continued industrialisation and management of the estate.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 18 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1076_2010-05-14.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/ea7f0e25-22c4-4db0-acfd-723c87d73679?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/ea7f0e25-22c4-4db0-acfd-723c87d73679?s=SM"

It is probably the single most important public rite observed by the community every year between January 14 and February 14. Most Hindu festivals fall either on full moon day (Punarpusam) or on new-moon day (Amavasi). “Thai Pusam” occurs on the full moon day in the Tamil month “Thai” (January–February). Thaipusam is actually derived from Thai which means “10th”, and Pusam meaning “when the moon is at its brightest”. It is thus celebrated in the month of “Thai” (10th month according to the Tamil Almanac) on the day when the moon passes through the star “Pusam”. Thaipusam is a day of prayers and penance. Dedicated to Lord Subramaniam, also known as Lord Murugan, a major South Indian god, the deity of youth, power and virtue, this festival is a time for repentance for devotees with celebrations carried out mainly at the temple.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 12 KB, 2 p..","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_760_2004-12-27.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/deea4c72-513b-4f08-95a7-3f41b5a0eff0?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/deea4c72-513b-4f08-95a7-3f41b5a0eff0?s=SM"

The protestors, who were all Chinese nationals, were aggrieved at the disparity between their wages and those of their Malaysian counterparts. They were also disgruntled at the poor living conditions and how their complaints had been ignored. The two-day strike was deemed illegal under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, as the workers had disrupted an essential service without the requisite two weeks’ notice.

The art of paan or betel chewing dates back to the pre-Vedic Saivite Harappan empire, and the activity is also known as makan sireh in Malaysia and Singapore. It requires three different plants used in combination: the betel nut which is the seed of the areca palm, the betel leaf which comes from the pan plant, and lime. The leaf is first daubed with lime paste and topped with thin slices of the nut before it is folded or rolled into a bite-size quid. It acts as a mouth freshener, helps digestion and creates a sense of euphoria almost like chocolate does. A betel chewer is recognised by the red staining of the mouth, gum, teeth and lips. Generating a large amount of saliva, the excess juices are spat out. These little morsels are sold on the streets or market. In traditional Indian households, a good host would offer a silver tray piled with a pyramid of paan after a sumptuous meal. The chewing of betel leaf (vettilai in Tamil) is more popular among the South Indians.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. 21 KB, 3 p..","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_883_2004-12-17.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/e6f4151a-aef8-4d61-b509-f54cd9049c71?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/e6f4151a-aef8-4d61-b509-f54cd9049c71?s=SM"

Six months later, the deadline was brought forward to 1971. The sudden pull-out of British forces presented serious problems to Singapore’s defence and economic security. At the time, the Singapore Armed Forces was in its infancy, and the British military bases were contributing over 20 percent to Singapore’s gross national product. To counter these problems, Singapore embarked on a rapid industrialisation programme, tightened its labour laws to attract foreign investments, strengthened its defence through military cooperation with other countries, and tripled its military spending. By the deadline, Singapore had achieved strong economic growth and nearly full employment. Most of the British troops had moved out of Singapore by October 1971, leaving a token number behind.

The flag was subsequently adopted as the national flag when Singapore became an independent nation on 9 August 1965.  Regulation on the use and display of the flag first took effect on 30 November 1959 under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance.  Greater flexibility in the use of the national flag was introduced on 1 January 2004 and 16 July 2007 to encourage more frequent use of the flag among Singaporeans.

During the early years of independence, national survival and nation-building were the foremost concerns of the PAP government. At the time, Singapore was plagued by a series of acute problems including over-population, unemployment, housing shortage and racial tension. Led by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the PAP government implemented a range of economic and social policies to address the issues and was able to overcome the situation with remarkable success. By constantly fielding new candidates for each general election and recruiting new members, the PAP maintains a systematic self-renewal process at all levels. In 1992, Lee Kuan Yew was succeeded by Goh Chok Tong as the party’s secretary-general, who was then succeeded by Lee Hsien Loong in 2004.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","All Rights Reserved.

It is approximately 113 km long and 5 to 12 km wide, although its narrowest navigable width is 2.9 km. It is on the shipping route of the Asia Pacific region, linking East Asia to Europe. This makes it one of the busiest sea lanes in the world hence, highly vulnerable to oil spills. Furthermore, besides being one of the world’s busiest container ports, Singapore is also a marine bunking centre, as well as an oil refining centre with a high volume of marine trade and shipping traffic daily. According to the 1999 Oil Spill Intelligence Report, the Straits of Singapore is considered to be one of the world’s hot spots for oil spills.

His link to the pre-1819 history of Singapore is his founding of a settlement called Singapura on the island Temasek sometime in 1299 (r. 1299–1347). The sighting of a lion by Sang Utama is often told to explain the renaming of Temasek to Singapura (“City of the Sea Lion” in Sanskrit). On founding Singapura, Sang Utama assumed the title of Sri Tri Buana (“Lord of Three Worlds” in Sanskrit). Sang Utama’s descendants ruled Singapore until the reign of Iskandar Shah, the fifth ruler of Singapore, who was driven out by the Majapahit (Javanese) forces and later founded the kingdom of Malacca.

As president of the Singapore Organisation of Seamen in the 1970s and early ’80s, Hamid successfully negotiated for wage reforms for seamen, concluded collective agreements with various shipowners concerning the working conditions of seamen, and rallied the region’s maritime unions to fight against the discrimination of Asian seamen by the International Transport Workers’ Federation.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-03-09_112253.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/18de041e-492a-4029-b76f-382523aaa832?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/18de041e-492a-4029-b76f-382523aaa832?s=SM"

In the ’80s and ’90s, the focus shifted towards fine-tuning the PSLE grading system so that pupils would enter the most appropriate secondary-level academic stream. From the 2000s onwards, the PSLE framework was further tweaked to de-emphasise competition and encourage the holistic development of children.

The bilingualism policy has been implemented primarily through the education system, which requires students to study the English language and their respective mother tongues. In addition, annual campaigns are held to promote the learning and speaking of mother tongue languages as well as to encourage the use of grammatically correct English among Singaporeans.

Cricket was particularly popular while other sports such as hockey, tennis and soccer were also promoted. The club has produced many outstanding sports teams since the 1920s, and several well-known cricket and hockey players in Malaya and Singapore had played with the club.

Although modelled after similar legislation found in the state of Western Australia, the ordinance was unique in trying to create a trade dispute settlement system that combined freely initiated collective bargaining with compulsory arbitration in a way that suited local conditions. The legislation had two main objectives: first, to ensure that workers were fairly rewarded for their labour; and second, to bring about stable industrial relations in Singapore that would enable economic growth and job creation.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","All Rights Reserved.

In the 1960s, tea dances organised by clubs became the centre of the rock ’n’ roll culture in Singapore. Such tea dances eventually died out due to a clampdown by the authorities in response to frequent brawls occurring at these events. In the mid-1980s, the government revived tea dances to matchmake young Singaporeans, and discotheques subsequently organised tea dances on weekend afternoons for teenagers. This trend waned as well when the authorities deemed the activity to be a bad influence on youths, which led to a ban on those under the age of 16 from attending.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-03-14_133541.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/471cb42a-9533-4ea8-85f2-f8a4c8dc3353?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/471cb42a-9533-4ea8-85f2-f8a4c8dc3353?s=SM"

The cowherd and weaving lady are two out of 28 astronomical segments, otherwise known as celestial spheres or equatorial divisions (lunar mansions), which ancient Chinese had mapped out based on the movement of the circumpolar stars around the pole star. The ninth lunar mansion, Chien Niu (牵牛) or Cowherd (Altair or Vega), and the 10th lunar mansion, Chih Nu (织女) or Weaving Lady (Acuilae or Lyrae), are located close to each other.

After Singapore attained self-government in 1959, art and music were regarded as non-core subjects and often taught outside of regular school hours. By the early 1980s, both subjects received greater attention from the government because the emphasis of the education system had shifted from industrial and technological training towards a broad-based education aimed at the holistic development of youths. To nurture students’ talent in art and music, the Music Elective Programme (MEP) was introduced in 1982, followed by the Art Elective Programme (AEP) in 1984. During the 21st century, the number of specialised arts institutions in Singapore increased while arts education was also enhanced in order to train talents to fill jobs in the arts sector.

The reserves also provide a continual stream of income for current and future generations. Recognising its strategic importance, the government has been building up the national reserves over the last few decades. To protect this nest egg from potential misuse, the government needs the consent of the president before it can draw on past reserves. In October 2008, the president’s approval was sought for a S$150-million guarantee on all local bank deposits to be backed by past reserves.

It is neither acid, nor sweet, nor juicy, yet one feels the want of none of these qualities, for it is perfect as it is”. There were others who also spoke strongly about the fruit, but to contrary effect. Probably no other fruit has had so many contradictory descriptions written of its smell and flavour. Durians are not plucked but allowed to fall, which is when they are best consumed.","na","National Library Board Singapore","text/html :. .","eng","na","admin","na","http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_871_2005-01-11.html","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/c01d67f9-c903-4cc0-a7db-2c478a4552d4?s=MD","http://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/bookcoverwrapper/cover/c01d67f9-c903-4cc0-a7db-2c478a4552d4?s=SM"

The word ‘bukum’ is said to come from the Malay name for a shell called ‘rangkek bukom’ which is wide at one end and tapers to a narrow point– the shape of Bukom Besar prior to man-made changes to it. The word ‘bukum’ is also said to come from ‘hukum’ which is Malay (from Arab origins) for order, command, judicial decision or sentence.
